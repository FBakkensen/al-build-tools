# Build Instructions
- First run pwd to ensure you are in the correct directory where the makefile is located.
- Run `make build` from the workspace root to compile the project.
- The build must finish **without any errors or warnings**. If any warning or error appears in the build output, the task is not complete and must be fixed before proceeding.
