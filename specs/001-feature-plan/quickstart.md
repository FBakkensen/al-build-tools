## Quickstart: Static Analysis Quality Gate

1. Open a PR modifying files under `overlay/` or `bootstrap/`.
2. GitHub Actions runs job `static-analysis` automatically.
3. View Checks tab â†’ see annotations inline (shell, PowerShell, JSON issues).
4. Fix blocking issues (Syntax, Security, Configuration, Policy, Style) until status passes. Advisory issues may remain but are reported.
5. Push changes; workflow re-runs.

PowerShell analyzer behavior:
- `PSScriptAnalyzer` is REQUIRED. Its findings are enforced (can block) using the same category rules.
- If it is NOT installed the run records a blocking Configuration issue: "PSScriptAnalyzer not installed" and the quality gate fails.

Local replication (Linux):
```
bash scripts/ci/run-static-analysis.sh
```
(Script will exit non-zero on blocking findings.)
