# Implementation Plan: Add Automated Tests for install.ps1

**Branch**: `005-add-tests-for` | **Date**: 2025-09-16 | **Spec**: specs/005-add-tests-for/spec.md
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/005-add-tests-for/spec.md`

## Summary
Add comprehensive cross-platform automated tests (Pester) validating bootstrap installer (`install.ps1`) reliability, guard rails, deterministic overwrite, diagnostic stability, and failure category reporting without expanding overlay public surface.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: PowerShell 7+ (tests), minimal shell usage
**Primary Dependencies**: Git, PowerShell, Pester (existing test framework)
**Storage**: N/A
**Testing**: Pester integration + contract style (mirrors existing `tests/contract` & `tests/integration` organization)
**Target Platform**: Windows + Ubuntu (parity required)
**Project Type**: Single toolkit repository
**Performance Goals**: Successful default run <30s (FR-010)
**Constraints**: No network dependency beyond required GitHub ref download; overlay ephemeral; no added runtime dependencies
**Scale/Scope**: Single script behavioral contract; ~25 requirements traced

## Constitution Check (Initial)
Simplicity: Single project; no new frameworks; direct use of Pester.
Architecture: No new libraries; tests only.
Testing: RED-GREEN to be followed when adding failing tests first for any new installer diagnostic adjustments.
Observability: Structured single-line diagnostics specified.
Versioning: Behavioral contract documented in contracts README.
Result: PASS (no deviations)

## Phase 0: Research Output
See `research.md` for decisions on temp workspace detection, performance thresholds, idempotence verification, failure diagnostics, permission simulation, and parity strategies. All unknowns resolved.

## Phase 1: Design Output
Artifacts generated:
- `research.md`
- `data-model.md`
- `contracts/README.md`
- `quickstart.md`
Traceability table in data-model maps FR-001..FR-025.

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
Outlined (to be materialized in `tasks.md` later):
- Derive one test task per functional requirement cluster (group similar FRs: guard rails, overwrite, parity, diagnostics, performance).
- Include setup helpers for: temp workspace capture, file hashing, dirty repo simulation.
- Mark parity verification tasks parallelizable.
- Ensure initial commit introduces failing tests for any not-yet-implemented diagnostics (e.g., standardized `[install] download failure` format if not present).

Ordering:
1. Guard rail failure tests (fail fast scenarios)
2. Success path + idempotent overwrite
3. Failure categories (network simulation stubs/mocks via invalid refs, set hosts file scenario if needed)
4. Temp workspace lifecycle
5. Performance threshold measurement
6. Parity + structural comparison

## Complexity Tracking
