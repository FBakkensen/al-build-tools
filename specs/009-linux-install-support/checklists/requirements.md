# Specification Quality Checklist: Linux Installation Support

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: October 25, 2025
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Iteration 1 - Initial Validation (October 25, 2025)

**Content Quality**: ✅ PASS
- Specification focuses on WHAT and WHY, not HOW
- Written for business stakeholders with clear user scenarios
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) completed
- No technology-specific implementation details in spec body

**Requirement Completeness**: ✅ PASS
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present
- All 20 functional requirements are testable with clear verbs (MUST)
- Success criteria include specific metrics (e.g., "under 5 minutes", "95%+ consistency", "100% pass rate")
- Success criteria are technology-agnostic (focus on user outcomes, not implementation)
- Edge cases identified covering apt locking, privilege escalation, repository states
- Scope clearly bounded with "Out of Scope" section (non-Ubuntu distros, ARM, offline scenarios)
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

**Feature Readiness**: ✅ PASS
- All functional requirements mapped to user stories through acceptance scenarios
- User scenarios cover clean install (P1), interactive mode (P2), testing (P3), diagnostics (P4)
- Each user story has independent test criteria
- No implementation leakage (no mention of specific file names, functions, or code structure)

### Summary

**Status**: ✅ READY FOR PLANNING

All checklist items pass. Specification is complete, unambiguous, and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`.

## Notes

- Specification correctly avoids mentioning specific script names, functions, or implementation patterns while maintaining clarity about required behavior
- Windows/Linux parity requirements appropriately focus on observable outcomes (diagnostics, exit codes) rather than code structure
- Edge cases appropriately challenge the boundaries (apt locking, sudo privileges, network failures)
- Success criteria are measurable and technology-agnostic (e.g., "installation in under 5 minutes" rather than "script executes efficiently")
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults for Ubuntu environment, package managers, and user permissions
- Out of Scope section prevents feature creep while acknowledging future expansion possibilities
